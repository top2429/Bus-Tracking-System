# Bus Tracking System

## About the Project
An app that helps track the live location of college buses with ease!!!
It uses Flutter and Google Maps API to get the live location of drivers and users,
and displays the estimated time the bus will take to reach the user's stop 
so that they can board the bus without any hassel.

## Motive
To provide convenience to the students availing of the bus facility.
To minimize the chances of missing a student 

## Permissions Required
-  Location Access
-  Send user data to database
-  Notification Alert

## Tech Stack
- [ ] Flutter
- [ ] Firebase

## Functionality
### Functionality of Flutter Firebase:

- Authentication: Flutter Firebase provides authentication services, allowing you to easily implement user authentication and management in your Flutter app using Firebase Authentication.

- Real-time Database: Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows you to store and sync data in real time. With Flutter Firebase, you can easily integrate Firebase Realtime Database into your Flutter app and manage real-time data updates.

- Cloud Firestore: Firebase Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL database for mobile, web, and server development. Flutter Firebase provides seamless integration with Cloud Firestore, allowing you to store and query structured data in your Flutter app.

- Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage provides a secure and scalable solution for storing and serving user-generated content such as images, videos, and files. With Flutter Firebase, you can easily upload, download, and manage files in Firebase Cloud Storage.

- Remote Config: Firebase Remote Config allows you to remotely configure and customize your app without requiring users to update the app. With Flutter Firebase, you can easily use Remote Config to define and deploy parameters that can be changed in real time.

### Functionality of Flutter Maps:

- Map Display: Flutter Maps provides a variety of map display options, including interactive maps, static maps, and custom map styles. You can integrate popular map providers like Google Maps, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap into your Flutter app.

- Markers and Overlays: Flutter Maps allows you to add markers, overlays, and other visual elements to the map. You can display custom icons, info windows, polygons, polylines, and more to enhance the user experience.

- User Location: Flutter Maps provides functionality to access and display the user's current location on the map. You can track the user's location in real time and display it as a marker or update the map view accordingly.

- Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding: Flutter Maps supports geocoding and reverse geocoding, which allows you to convert addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice versa. This enables you to search for locations, display addresses on the map, and perform location-based queries.

- Routing and Directions: Flutter Maps provides routing and directions functionality, allowing you to calculate and display routes between multiple locations. You can show turn-by-turn directions, estimated travel times, and alternative routes on the map.

- Gestures and Interactions: Flutter Maps supports various gestures and interactions, such as panning, zooming, rotation, and tilt. Users can interact with the map using touch gestures to explore and navigate the map view.
